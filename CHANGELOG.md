## [11.0.0](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-core/compare/v10.12.1...v11.0.0) (2021-05-21)


### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

* All the interfaces that previously returned `q.Promise` have now been replaced with native es6 `Promise`s. Calling code will need to be updated.
* All options deprecated in previous versions have been removed. Migration instructions:

* In `VerifierOptions`: replace use of `tags`, `consumerVersionTag` and `providerVersionTag` with the appropriate `consumerVersionTags` or `providerVersionTags` option.

* The following classes have had their `.create(options)` removed. Please use the appropriate constructor instead (for example, `new Verifier(options)`)
    * `Verifier`
    * `Publisher`
    * `Server`
    * `Stub`
* **docs:** The type for consumer version selectors in the verifier has been corrected. This will affect typescript users who were using consumerVersionSelectors with the fields `pacticipant`, `all` or `version`. These fields never worked, and now will no longer compile in typescript. The correct type is:

```
ConsumerVersionSelector {
  tag?: string;
  latest?: boolean;
  consumer?: string;
  fallbackTag?: string;
}
```

Note that `pacticipant`, `version` and `all` have been removed. Existing code that uses `pacticipant` needs to use `consumer` instead. The other fields can be dropped. Any questions, please reach out to us at https://slack.pact.io/
* fix https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-core/issues/285

* **docs:** Add description of consumer version selectors to the documentation. ([1bdb45d](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-core/commit/1bdb45dfb82bfb2dcf4a01f88f2f2206681e3913))

* **can-i-deploy:** Options for CanDeploy have changed. Now, pacticipants are specified by an array of { name: <string>, latest?: <string | boolean>, version?: <string> }, allowing more than one pacticipant to be specified. You must specify one of latest
or version. If latest is `true`, the latest pact is used. If it is string, then the latest pact with that tag is used.
* **CanDeploy:** CanDeploy now defaults to json output (and returns the parsed object as the result of the promise. If you were using CanDeploy and relied on parsing the logged output, you will need to explicitly set `output: table` in your CanDeploy options.
