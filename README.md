| :information_source: Usage notice  |
|:-----------------------------------------|
| This is a core library, designed for use in the bowels of another package. Unless you are wanting to develop tools for the pact ecosystem, you almost certainly want to install [`@pact-foundation/pact`](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/) instead|

# Pact-JS Core

A wrapper for the [Pact](http://pact.io) [Reference Core Library](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference).

## Installation

`npm install @pact-foundation/pact-core --save-dev`

### Do Not Track

In order to get better statistics as to who is using Pact, we have an anonymous tracking event that triggers when Pact installs for the first time. To respect your privacy, anyone can turn it off by simply adding a 'do not track' flag within their package.json file:

```json
{
 "name": "some-project",
 ...
 "config": {
  "pact_do_not_track": true
 },
 ...
}
```

## Which Library/Package should I use?

TL;DR - you almost always want Pact JS.

| Purpose                   | Library   | Comments                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Synchronous / HTTP APIs   | Pact JS   |                                                                                                                     |
| Asynchronous APIs         | Pact JS   |                                                                                                                     |
| Node.js                   | Pact JS   |                                                                                                                     |
| Browser testing           | Pact Web  | You probably still want Pact JS. See [Using Pact in non-Node environments](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js#using-pact-in-non-node-environments) \* |
| Isomorphic testing        | Pact Web  | You probably still want Pact JS. See [Using Pact in non-Node environments](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js#using-pact-in-non-node-environments) \* |
| Publishing to Pact Broker | Pact CLI  |                                                                                     |

\* The "I need to run it in the browser" question comes up occasionally. The question is this - for your JS code to be able to make a call to another API, is this dependent on browser-specific code? In most cases, people use tools like React/Angular which have libraries that work on the server and client side, in which case, these tests don't need to run in a browser and could instead be executed in a Node.js environment.

## Documentation

### Set Log Level

var pact = require("@pact-foundation/pact-core");
